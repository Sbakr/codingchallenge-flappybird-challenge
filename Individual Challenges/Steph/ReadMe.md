# Steps(Jan 8th 2018)
- I opened HTML on brackets and on chrome then linked up my sketch.js
- I made sure I knew how to create a canvas on brackets
- Next I learned how to overlap different js files before I even started looking at Dan's code (It's good to familiarize yourself with your tools before starting)
- I started following alng with his video and am currently at 4:50 seconds
- So far my bird shows on a blank canvas and gravity can pull it down and stop it at the bottom of the screen

# (Jan 9th 2018)
- I continued to code along with Dan
- I noticed that most of my issues came from small typing errors like forgetting a period or a letter (make sure to mention that to coders)
- I had a few issues with my code not working and i just had to reopen the document and then it ran
- I tried to guess a few times what the code was before Dan gave the answer. That way I can test my understanding
- I made sure to test everything in the browser before moving on

# (Jan 12th 2018)
- I finished coding
- I added a design to my bird rather than him being just a plan white circle
- I'm going to think about adding a counter or lives
